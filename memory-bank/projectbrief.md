# Project Brief

## Overview

AWS ECR Utils is a command-line utility tool for managing and analyzing AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repositories. The tool provides a convenient way to scan and manage ECR repositories using local AWS profiles and stores repository information in a local SQLite database for quick access and analysis.

## Problem Statement

Managing AWS ECR repositories at scale presents several challenges:

1. **Visibility**: Difficulty in tracking repository sizes, image counts, and usage patterns
2. **Maintenance**: Identifying unused or outdated images for cleanup
3. **Analysis**: Understanding tag patterns and repository growth over time
4. **Efficiency**: Need for quick access to repository information without AWS Console

## Solution

AWS ECR Utils addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Local Database**: SQLite storage for quick access to repository data
2. **Analysis Tools**: Commands for repository statistics and image analysis
3. **Management Features**: Suggestions for cleanup and optimization
4. **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tools for common operations

## Key Features

1. **Repository Scanning**
   - Scan ECR repositories using AWS credentials
   - Store metadata in local SQLite database
   - Support for multiple AWS regions

2. **Data Analysis**
